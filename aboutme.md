## Field of Research Interest

My research interest includes, but not confined to:

* SLAM using LiDAR, camera, or radar sensors
* Robust 3D point cloud registration
* Mobile robotics including autonomous vehicles
* All kinds of perception that help perceiving neighbor situations
    * In particular, ground segmentation as pre-processing by using a 3D point cloud
    * Instance segmentation and clustering
* Localization including visual localization (i.e. visual place recognition)
* Static map building by updating a prior 3D point cloud map
* Robust visual(-inertial) odometry
* Analytical redundancy
