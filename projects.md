Developed SLAM algorithm applied to mobile robots. Was in charge of depth prediction using a 2D LiDAR sensor and a monocular camera for collision avoidance of mobile robots via Deep Learning.

Keywords: 2D LiDAR, Sensor Fusion, Deep Learning, Mobile Robots, PyTorch, ROS

## IITP Artificial Intelligence R&D Grand Challenge: Track 4, Intelligent Control

*Supported by IITP, which is a government-affiliated organization*


Was in charge of the task of a drone passing through windows. Implemented RGB-D camera-based path planning&following. Participated in applying VIO to achieve the Odometry of UAV.

Keywords: VIO, Path Planning and Following, Camera Geometry, OpenCV, ROS
