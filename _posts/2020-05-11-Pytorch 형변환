ur tensor is tensor.cuda.FloatTensor, converting using tensor.

your DoubleTensor removes cuda. Better to use tensor.double() because it works for both cpu and gpu tensors.



# rather than
# xyz_pred = xyz_pred.type(torch.DoubleTensor)
# ypr_pred = ypr_pred.type(torch.DoubleTensor)

# better
xyz_pred = xyz_pred.type(torch.cuda.DoubleTensor)
ypr_pred = ypr_pred.type(torch.cuda.DoubleTensor)
